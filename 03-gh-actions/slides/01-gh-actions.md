## What are GitHub Actions?
- CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub
- Automate tasks within the software development lifecycle
- Trigger workflows based on events (e.g., push, pull request)
- Use predefined or custom actions
- Run jobs on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners


---

## What is CI/CD?
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically build and test code changes to ensure they integrate well
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploy code changes to production or staging environments after passing tests
- Benefits: Faster development cycles, improved code quality, reduced manual errors

---

## Key Concepts
- **Workflow**: Automated process defined in a YAML file, triggered by events
- **Job**: A set of steps that execute on the same runner
- **Step**: A single task within a job, can be an action or a shell command
- **Action**: A reusable unit of code that can be shared and used in workflows
