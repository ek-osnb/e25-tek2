## Why DNS?

- When you type a URL into your web browser, such as `www.ek.dk`, your computer needs to find the corresponding IP address to connect to the web server hosting that site.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** is like the phonebook of the internet, translating **human-friendly domain names** into machine-friendly **IP addresses**.

---

## IP Addresses & Hostnames

- **Host name**: **`www.ek.dk`**
A human-readable label that is assigned to a device connected to a network. Hostnames are easier to remember than IP addresses.
    - Domain: **`ek.dk`**
    - Subdomain: **`www`**
    - Top-Level Domain (TLD): **`.dk`**

- **IP Address**: **20.50.2.66**
A unique string of numbers separated by periods (IPv4) that identifies each computer using the Internet Protocol to communicate over a network.

---

## IP Addresses

**IPv4**: 
32-bit (4 bytes) address, written as four decimal numbers separated by dots:
```bash
      20 .      50  .        2 .       66
00010100 . 00110010 . 00000010 . 01000010
```
- Has a limited address space (about 4.3 billion addresses).

**IPv6**:
128-bit (16 bytes) address, written as eight groups of four **hexadecimal** digits separated by colons:
```bash
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
```
- Vastly larger address space (about `3.4 x 10^38` addresses).

---
## IP Address Space
**IPv4**:
- Approximately 4.3 billion addresses (2^32).
- The range of IP addresses is from `0.0.0.0` to `255.255.255.255`.
- But many are reserved for a special purpose:
    - Private networks: (e.g., `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` to `172.31.x.x`)
    - Multicast addresses: (e.g., `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`)
    - Loopback addresses: (e.g., `127.0.0.1`)

---

## Why separate Names and IP Addresses?

- **Memorability**: Domain names are easier for humans to remember than numerical IP addresses.
    - `www.ek.dk` vs `20.50.2.66`
- **Flexibility**: IP addresses can change (e.g., when a website moves to a different server), but the domain name can remain the same.
    - Moving `www.ek.dk` to a new IP address doesn't require users to learn a new address.
- **Scalability**: A single domain name can point to multiple IP addresses (e.g., for load balancing or redundancy).
    - `www.ek.dk` can resolve to multiple servers to handle more traffic.
- **Multiple aliases**:
    - `www.ek.dk`, `ek.dk` point to the same IP address.

---

## Domain Name System (DNS)

**Problem:** How do we translate domain names to IP addresses?

**Solution:** The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system that maps domain names to IP addresses.

---

## First approach: Centralized server

- A single server that maintains a database of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.
- When a user wants to access a website, their computer queries this central server to get the IP address.
- All queries go to this one server.

**Question:** What are the potential issues with this approach?

---

## Domain Name System (DNS)

- Instead of a centralized server, DNS uses a **distributed** and **hierarchical** approach.
- DNS is made up of many servers around the world, each responsible for different parts of the domain name space.
- When a user wants to access a website, their computer queries multiple DNS servers in a **hierarchical** manner to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

---

## Hierarchical Structure of DNS
**DNS hierarchy is organized in levels:**
- **Root Level**: The top level, represented by a dot `.`.
- **Top-Level Domains (TLDs)**: Below the root, such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, and country-code TLDs like `.dk`, `.uk`, `.jp`.
- **Authoritative Servers**: Each TLD has authoritative servers that manage the next level down, which includes second-level domains (e.g., `ek` in `ek.dk`).

---

## Root nameservers
- As of today (2025), there are 1994 root servers worldwide, operated by 12 organizations.
- There are 13 root server addresses, labeled A through M, but each address can correspond to multiple physical servers.

![root servers](assets/root-servers.png)

---

## DNS Resolution Process

- When you type a URL into your browser, your computer initiates a **DNS query** to resolve the domain name to an IP address.

![dns resolution](assets/dns-resolution.png)

---

## The 8 steps in a DNS lookup
1. Your computer asks a **recursive resolver** (usually provided by your ISP or a public DNS service like Google DNS or Cloudflare DNS) to resolve the domain name.
2. The recursive resolver asks a **root nameserver** for the TLD (e.g., `.dk`).
3. The root nameserver responds with the address of a **TLD nameserver** for `.dk`.
4. The recursive resolver then asks the TLD nameserver for the domain (e.g., `ek.dk`).
5. The TLD nameserver responds with the address of the **authoritative nameserver** for `ek.dk`.
6. Finally, the recursive resolver asks the authoritative nameserver for the IP address of `www.ek.dk`.
7. The authoritative nameserver responds with the IP address (e.g., `20.50.2.66`).
8. The recursive resolver returns this IP address to your computer.

---

## Recursive vs. iterative queries

- **Recursive query**: It puts the burden of resolution on the DNS server. The server will query other servers on behalf of the client until it finds the answer or an error.
- **Iterative query**: The DNS server responds with the best answer it can provide based on its knowledge. If it doesn't know the answer, it will refer the client to another DNS server.

**Question:** Identify which steps in the DNS resolution process are recursive and which are iterative.

---

## Recursive vs authoritative resolvers

A **resolver** is a DNS client that initiates the DNS query process on behalf of the user.

- A **recursive resolver** (or DNS resolver) is responsible for handling the entire DNS resolution process, querying multiple DNS servers as needed to obtain the final IP address.

- An **authoritative resolver** (or authoritative nameserver) is a DNS server that holds the definitive records for a specific domain. It responds to queries about that domain with the actual IP addresses and other DNS records.

---

## DNS caching

- To improve efficiency and reduce latency, **DNS responses are often cached at various levels** (e.g., on your computer, by your ISP, or by the recursive resolver).

- Cached entries have a **Time To Live (TTL)** value, which indicates how long the entry should be kept before it is considered stale and needs to be refreshed.

- **Negative caching** is also used to store information about failed lookups, preventing repeated queries for non-existent domains.

---

## DNS records

- **A Record**: Maps a domain name to an **IPv4 address**.
- **AAAA Record**: Maps a domain name to an **IPv6 address**.
- **CNAME Record**: Canonical Name record, used to alias one domain name to another. E.g., `www.kea.dk` to `kea.dk`.
- **MX Record**: Mail Exchange record, specifies the mail server responsible for receiving email on behalf of a domain.
- **TXT Record**: Text record, used to store arbitrary text data, often for verification purposes (e.g., SPF records for email).
- **NS Record**: Name Server record, indicates which DNS server is authoritative for a particular domain.

---

---

## DNS lookup tools

**MacOS/Linux:**
- `nslookup`
- `dig`
- `host`

**Windows:**
- `nslookup`
- `dig` using a Docker container.

---

# `dig` command

**MAC:**
Use Homebrew (a package manager for macOS - can be installed from https://brew.sh/):
```bash
# Use homebrew to install bind (which includes dig):
brew install bind
```
**Windows:**
Use docker interactively:
```bash
docker run -it jonlabelle/network-tools bash
# If you get an error: the input device is not a TTY, use:
winpty docker run -it jonlabelle/network-tools bash
```

---

## Practical Example: Using `dig`

```bash
$ dig ek.dk
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> ek.dk
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 60213
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 1232
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;ek.dk.				IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
ek.dk.			600	IN	A	20.50.2.66

;; Query time: 24 msec

;; WHEN: Tue Oct 14 14:47:30 CEST 2025
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 50
```

---

## Practical Example: Using `dig +trace`
Shows path from **root servers** down to the **authoritative server** for the domain.

```bash
$ dig +trace ek.dk
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> +trace ek.dk
;; global options: +cmd
.			242548	IN	NS	m.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	e.root-servers.net.

.			242548	IN	NS	b.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	h.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	f.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	l.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	d.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	i.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	k.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	a.root-servers.net.
.			242548	IN	NS	g.root-servers.net.
```
---

<!-- ## Practical Example: Using `dig +trace` continued -->

```bash
;; Received 1109 bytes from 192.168.0.1#53(192.168.0.1) in 21 ms

dk.			172800	IN	NS	b.nic.dk.

dk.			172800	IN	NS	s.nic.dk.
dk.			172800	IN	NS	t.nic.dk.
```
---

<!-- ## Practical Example: Using `dig +trace` continued -->

```bash
;; Received 733 bytes from 170.247.170.2#53(b.root-servers.net) in 29 ms

ek.dk.			86400	IN	NS	ns.efif.dk.
ek.dk.			86400	IN	NS	ns2.efif.dk.
ek.dk.			86400	IN	NS	ns3.efif.dk.

;; Received 366 bytes from 194.0.28.7#53(s.nic.dk) in 23 ms

ek.dk.			600	IN	A	20.50.2.66
```
- The result is the IP address of `ek.dk`: `20.50.2.66`.

**Questions:** What is the TTL and which record types are returned?

---

## `dig +trace` explanation

When using `dig +trace`, you can see the entire resolution path from the root servers down to the authoritative server for the domain.

- This is actually a *"hack"* because `dig` is performing the iterative queries on your behalf, simulating what a recursive resolver would do.

---

## Exercise: DNS Lookup

1. Use **`nslookup`** to find the IP address of `ek.dk`.
2. Use **`dig`** to perform a DNS query for `ek.dk` and try different query types (A, AAAA, MX, etc.).
3. Use **`dig +trace ek.dk`** to see the full resolution path from the root servers down to the authoritative server.
    - Which servers were contacted?
    - Identify the root, TLD and authoritative servers.
    - Do it repeatedly what happens to the results?

---

## Inserting records into DNS

- DNS records are typically managed by the domain owner through a DNS hosting provider or registrar.
- Changes to DNS records (like adding an A record or MX record) are made through a web interface or API provided by the DNS hosting service.
- Once changes are made, they need to propagate through the DNS system, which can take time due to caching and TTL values.
- The TTL (Time To Live) value determines how long a DNS record is cached by resolvers before they must query the authoritative server again for updated information.

---

## Security Considerations
- **DNS Spoofing/Cache Poisoning**: Attackers can manipulate DNS responses to redirect users to malicious sites.
- **DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions)**: A suite of extensions that add a layer of security to DNS by enabling DNS responses to be verified for authenticity.
- **Privacy Concerns**: DNS queries can reveal browsing habits; using encrypted DNS (like DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS) can help mitigate this.
- **DDoS Attacks**: DNS servers can be targeted in Distributed Denial of Service attacks, overwhelming them with traffic and making them unavailable.

---

# DEMO: Registering a domain and setting up DNS records
- Register a domain through a registrar (simply.com, one.com, etc.).
- Use the registrar's DNS management tools to add records:
    - Add an A record to point `yourdomain.com` to your server's IP address.
    - Add a CNAME record for `www.yourdomain.com` to point to `yourdomain.com`.
- We need a web server to respond to HTTP requests.

---

## Exercise: Setting up DNS records
1. Register a domain name through a registrar (e.g., simply.com, one.com).
2. Use the registrar's DNS management tools to add the following records:
    - An A record to point `yourdomain.com` to a public IP address (you can use a placeholder IP if you don't have one).
    - A CNAME record for `www.yourdomain.com` to point to `yourdomain.com`.
3. Use `dig` or `nslookup` to verify that the records have been added correctly.

---

# DNS propagation time

- DNS changes can take time to propagate throughout the internet due to caching at various levels (local DNS resolver, ISP, etc.).
- The time it takes for DNS changes to propagate can vary based on the TTL (Time To Live) settings of the DNS records.
- Lower TTL values can lead to faster propagation but may increase the load on DNS servers.
- It's common to wait anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours for DNS changes to fully propagate.

**See a visualization of DNS propagation at https://dnschecker.org/**

---

# Adding TLS to a nginx server

When hosting a website, it's important to secure the connection using SSL/TLS. This ensures that data transmitted between the user's browser and the web server is **encrypted**.
- Encryption protects the data from being intercepted by malicious actors.

- TLS also provides **authentication**, ensuring that users are connecting to the legitimate website and not an imposter.


---

# Practical Example: Using Let's Encrypt with Nginx

1. On the VM hosting your Nginx server, install Certbot:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    ```
2. Obtain an TLS certificate for your domain:
    ```bash
    sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
    ```
3. Follow the prompts to complete the certificate installation.
4. Certbot will automatically configure Nginx to use the new TLS certificate.

**Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain name.**


---

# Exercise: Setting up TLS with Let's Encrypt

## Using Digital Oceans DNS management
**Why change DNS providers?**
- Centralized management for multiple domains.
- Easy to update records.
- Reliable DNS hosting.
- Digital Ocean exposes a simple UI and **REST API** for managing DNS records.
- It's free to use if you have a Digital Ocean account.

---

# DNS & HTTP

Once the DNS resolution is complete and you have the IP address of the web server, your browser can establish a connection to the server using the **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** to request and receive web pages.

---

![dns and http](assets/dns-full.png)

---

# HTTP

HTTP is a text-based protocol used for communication between clients (like web browsers) and servers. It consists of **requests** sent by the client and **responses** sent by the server.

HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.

HTTP is **stateless**, meaning each request from a client to a server is independent and unrelated to previous requests.

---

## Structure of an HTTP request

```http
GET /books HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: application/json

```

---

## Structure of an HTTP response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 85

{
  "books": [
    {"id": 1, "title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell"},
    {"id": 2, "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee"}
    ]
}
```

---

## General HTTP structure

```bash
+---------------------------------------+
| Start Line (req) or Status Line (res) | <- Method, Path, Version or Version, Status Code
+---------------------------------------+
| Headers                               | <- Key-Value pairs
+---------------------------------------+
| Blank Line                            | <- CRLF to indicate end of headers
+---------------------------------------+
| Body (optional)                       | <- Body content
+---------------------------------------+
```

**Question:**
- How does it now how long the status line and headers are?
- What separates the headers from the body?

---
## HTTP line endings

- It uses the CRLF (Carriage Return Line Feed) sequence to indicate the end of each line, and a blank line (CRLF CRLF) to indicate the end of the headers section.
- CR = Carriage Return (ASCII 13) or `\r` - `0x0D` in hex
- LF = Line Feed (ASCII 10) or `\n` - `0x0A` in hex

---

## HTTP Line endings example

```http
GET /books HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: www.example.com\r\n
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1\r\n
Accept: application/json\r\n
\r\n
```

---

# HTTP Versions

- HTTP/0.9 is an early version and is largely obsolete.
- HTTP/1.0 (see [RFC 1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945)) - introduced the concept of headers and the ability to specify the type of content being sent.
- HTTP/1.1 (see [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230)) - improved performance and introduced persistent connections.
- HTTP/2 (see [RFC 7540](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540)) - introduced multiplexing (= multiple requests in one connection) and header compression.
- HTTP/3 (see [RFC 9114](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9114)) - built on QUIC for improved performance.

**We will focus on HTTP/1.1 for this course.**

---

## HTTP methods
- **GET**: Requests data from a specified resource. (e.g., loading a webpage)
- **POST**: Submits data to be processed to a specified resource. (e.g., submitting a form)
- **PUT**: Updates a current resource with new data.
- **DELETE**: Deletes the specified resource.
- **HEAD**: Similar to GET but only requests the headers, not the body.
- **OPTIONS**: Describes the communication options for the target resource.

---

## HTTP Status Codes
- **1xx (Informational)**: Request received, continuing process.
- **2xx (Success)**: The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
    - `200 OK`: The request has succeeded.
- **3xx (Redirection)**: Further action needs to be taken to complete the request.
    - `301 Moved Permanently`: The resource has been moved to a new URL.
    - `302 Found`: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.
- **4xx (Client Error)**: The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.
    - `404 Not Found`: The requested resource could not be found.
    - `403 Forbidden`: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **5xx (Server Error)**: The server failed to fulfill a valid request.
    - `500 Internal Server Error`: A generic error message when the server encounters an unexpected condition.
    - `502 Bad Gateway`: The server received an invalid response from the upstream server.

---

## HTTP headers
- HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent between the client and server to provide additional information about the request or response.
- Common request headers:
    - `Host`: Specifies the domain name of the server (e.g., `www.ek.dk`).
    - `Accept`: Specifies the media types that the client can process (e.g., `text/html`, `application/json`).
- Common response headers:
    - `Content-Type`: Indicates the media type of the resource (e.g., `text/html`).
    - `Content-Length`: The size of the response body in bytes.

---

# HTTPS

- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP.
- Builds on HTTP by adding a layer of encryption using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security).
- Ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and secure from eavesdropping or tampering.
- HTTPS uses port 443 by default, while HTTP uses port 80.

---

# OSI vs TCP/IP Model

When learning about networking, two common models are used to describe how data is transmitted over a network: the **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** model and the **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)** model.

- The OSI model has 7 layers, while the TCP/IP model has 4 layers.
- The TCP/IP model is more practical and widely used in real-world networking.

![OSI vs TCP](assets/OSI-vs-TCP.webp)

---

## OSI Model Overview 
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers.

**1. Physical Layer:** Deals with the physical connection between devices (e.g., cables, switches).
**2. Data Link Layer:** Manages data frames between devices on the same network (e.g., Ethernet, MAC addresses).
**3. Network Layer:** Handles routing of data packets across networks (e.g., IP addresses).
**4. Transport Layer:** Ensures reliable data transfer between devices (e.g., TCP, UDP).
**5. Session Layer:** Manages sessions or connections between applications.
**6. Presentation Layer:** Translates data formats and encrypts/decrypts data.
**7. Application Layer:** Interfaces with end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, DNS).

---
# TCP/IP Model Overview
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) model is a simplified framework used to understand and implement network protocols in four layers.
**1. Network Access Layer:** Combines the OSI's Physical and Data Link layers, dealing with the physical connection and data framing (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi).
**2. Internet Layer:** Corresponds to the OSI's Network layer, handling routing of data packets across networks (e.g., IP, ICMP).
**3. Transport Layer:** Similar to the OSI's Transport layer, ensuring reliable data transfer between devices (e.g., TCP, UDP).
**4. Application Layer:** Encompasses the OSI's Session, Presentation, and Application layers, interfacing with end-user applications (e.g., HTTP, DNS, FTP).

---

## How does DNS and HTTP fit into the models?

- Both DNS and HTTP operate at the **Application Layer** of the OSI model (Layer 7) and the TCP/IP model (Layer 4).
- They rely on lower layers (Transport, Internet, Network Access) to handle data transmission over the network.

---

# Protocols

### A protocol is a **set of rules** that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. 

### Different protocols operate at different layers of the OSI or TCP/IP model.

<!-- **Examples of common protocols:**
- HTTP/HTTPS
- DNS -->

---

## DNS protocol format
The DNS protocol uses two types of DNS messages, queries and responses; both have the same format. Each message consists of a header and four sections: question, answer, authority, and an additional space.


```bash
+---------------------+
|        Header       | DNS message header
+---------------------+
|       Question      | the question for the name server
+---------------------+
|        Answer       | RRs answering the question
+---------------------+
|      Authority      | RRs pointing toward an authority
+---------------------+
|      Additional     | RRs holding additional information
+---------------------+
```
---

## DNS Header Format

The DNS header is 12 bytes long and contains several fields that provide information about the DNS message.

<!-- _class: img-100 -->

![alt text](assets/dns-header.png)



<!-- ```bash
            +----------------------+----------------------+
            | Identification       | Flags                |
            +----------------------+----------------------+
            | Number of Questions  | Number of Answers    |
            +----------------------+----------------------+
            | Number of Authority  | Number of Additional |
            +----------------------+----------------------+
            | Questions                                   |
            +---------------------------------------------+
            | Answers                                     |
            +---------------------------------------------+
            | Authority                                   |
            +---------------------------------------------+
            | Additional                                  |
            +---------------------------------------------+

## Example: DNS query (in readable format)

```bash
            |----------------- 4 bytes -------------------|

            +----------------------+----------------------+
            | ID: 0x97cd           | Flags: 0x0120        |
            +----------------------+----------------------+
            | QDCOUNT: 0x0001      | ANCOUNT: 0x0000      |
            +----------------------+----------------------+
            | NSCOUNT: 0x0000      | ARCOUNT: 0x0001      |
            +----------------------+----------------------+
    QUERY:  | Name: ek.dk, Type: A, Class: IN             |
            +---------------------------------------------+
Additional: | Name: <ROOT>, Type: OPT,                    | 
            | UDP Payload Size: 0x1000                    |
            | RCODE: 0x00                                 |
            | EDNS Version: 0x00                          |
            | Z: 0x0000                                   |

**Difficult to read, right? Let's use Wireshark instead!**

## Intro to Wireshark
- Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures and displays network traffic in real-time.
- It allows you to see the details of network packets, including headers and payloads.
- Useful for troubleshooting network issues, analyzing protocols, and learning about network communication.
- Supports filtering, searching, and exporting packet data.
- Wireshark decomposes network traffic into its component protocols, and displays the details according to the OSI model (or TCP/IP model).

**But what is the OSI model?**

## Wireshark: Capturing DNS Traffic

- Open Wireshark and start a capture on your network interface (e.g., Wi-Fi).
- Use a filter to display only DNS traffic: `dns`

## Wireshark

Wireshark can capture network traffic and display it in a human-readable format.
- You can filter traffic by protocol (e.g., `dns`, `http`).
- There is extra information about each layer - we will explore this in the next lecture.

---

# Summary
- DNS translates human-friendly domain names into machine-friendly IP addresses.
- DNS is hierarchical and distributed, involving multiple types of servers (root, TLD, authoritative).
- Common DNS records include A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, and NS records.
- DNS queries can be recursive or iterative, and caching is used to improve performance.
- Wireshark is a tool for capturing and analyzing network traffic, including DNS queries and responses.

---

# Difference between browser and curl HTTP requests
- A web browser asks the server to **compress the content** (gzip, deflate) by using the `Accept-Encoding` header. This makes the response **smaller and faster** to download.
- `curl` does not ask for compressed content by default, so the server sends the full uncompressed response.
- Browsers also send additional headers like `User-Agent`, `Accept-Language`, and `Cookies` that `curl` does not include unless specified.

## Exercises: Capture DNS traffic using Wireshark
1. Start a Wireshark capture on your network interface (WiFi).
2. Use a filter to display only DNS traffic: `dns`.
3. Visit a website (e.g., `www.ek.dk`) in your web browser.
4. Analyze the DNS query and response packets to identify the different fields and their values.
    - What is the transaction ID?
    - What type of query was made (e.g., A, AAAA, CNAME)?
    - What is the IP address returned in the response?
    - What is the TTL value in the response?
    - How many answers are included in the response?
