# Subnet mask caclulation



## Example 1
**Given the IP address: `50.118.50.21/18`**

Determine:
- The subnet mask
- The network address
- The broadcast address
- The range of usable IP addresses
- Next subnet


### Solution

**Subnet Mask**: 

The `/18` indicates that the first 18 bits are used for the network portion of the address. This gives us the subnet mask:

- In binary: `11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000`
- In decimal: `255.255.192.0`

**Network Address**:

We need to determine the block size for the third octet:
```math
Block size = 256 - 192 = 64
```
This means the subnets in the third octet are:

```math
0, 64, 128, 192
```

The third octet is between `0` and `64`, so the network address is:

```math
50.118.0.0
```

**Broadcast Address**:

The broadcast address is the last address in the subnet. Since our block size is `64`, the broadcast address is:
```math
50.118.63.255
```

**Range of Usable IP Addresses**:

The usable IP addresses are those between the network address and the broadcast address, excluding both:
```math
50.118.0.1 - 50.118.63.254
```

**Next Subnet**:

The next subnet starts at the next block size:
```math
50.118.64.0
```

## Example 2
**Given the IP address: `179.26.96.91/19`**

Determine:
- The subnet mask
- The network address
- The broadcast address
- The range of usable IP addresses
- Next subnet

### Solution

**Subnet Mask**:

The `/19` indicates that the first 19 bits are used for the network portion of the address. This gives us the subnet mask:

- In binary: `11111111.11111111.11100000.00000000`
- In decimal: `255.255.224.0`

**Network Address**:

We need to determine the block size for the third octet:
```math
Block size = 256 - 224 = 32
```
This means the subnets in the third octet are:
```math
0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, 224
```
The third octet is between `96` and `128`, so the network address is:

```math
179.26.96.0
```

**Broadcast Address**:

The broadcast address is the last address in the subnet. Since our block size is `32`, the broadcast address is:
```math
179.26.127.255
```

**Range of Usable IP Addresses**:

The usable IP addresses are those between the network address and the broadcast address, excluding both:
```math
179.26.96.1 - 179.26.127.254
```

**Next Subnet**:

The next subnet starts at the next block size:
```math
179.26.128.0
```
